    <!-- Question-11
    → What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?
    Answer:- 
     * block-level element *
     → A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
     → A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
     * Example is block element *
     → The <p> element is a block-level element.
     → The <div> element is a block-level element.
     → <p>Hello Every one</p>  
     → <div>hello my dear freinds</div> 
     * inline element *
     → An inline element does not start on a new line.
     → An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
     * Example is inline element *
     → This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.
     → <p>hello my <span>dear</span> freinds</p>
     → <div><h1>india is <span>my</span> country</h1></div>   -->
