    <!-- Question-18
        
         ~> SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics . SVG is used to define vector-based graphics for the Web 
          The SVG file format is a popular tool for displaying two-dimensional graphics, charts, and illustrations on websites. Plus, as a 
          vector file, it can be scaled up or down without losing any of its resolution.
          If you need to turn an existing image into an SVG file, you will want to "trace" it using a bitmap tracer or an SVG Maker tool that 
          does the same thing in the background. A bitmap tracer identifies shapes, lines, and figures among the pixels and 'traces' the image 
          into a clean SVG for you.
