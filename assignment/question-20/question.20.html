     <!-- Question-20

    
          In HTML the formatting tags are divided into two parts:

                  (a).Physical tag:

          ~> These tags are used to provide the visual appearance to the text.

                  (b).Logical tag:

         ~>  These tags are used to add some logical or semantic value to the text.

         ~> Physical and Logical tags are used in HTML for better visibility and understanding of the text by the user on the web page. However, 
          both tags differ from each other as suggested by their names.
        
         ~> In HTML, a logical tag is a tag that describes the meaning or structure of the content it surrounds, while a physical tag describes 
          the presentation or appearance of the content.
